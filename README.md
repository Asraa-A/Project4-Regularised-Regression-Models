# Project4-Regularised-Regression-Models

Discriminating between healthy individuals and patients with
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
The importance of genetic predisposition, inflammation, and auto-immune mechanisms in the development of
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is becoming increasingly clear. It is hypothesised that the development
of PAH requires first a genetic susceptibility followed by one or several secondary trigger factors such as a
viral infection or drug exposure. The individualâ€™s genetic susceptibility and the interaction of the genotype
with the promoting factor(s) still remain areas of active research.


In this project we will hypothesise that the analysis of gene expression profiles from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells would distinguish patients with PAH from healthy individuals. The question of interest is
which genes (or combinations of genes) have an impact on patient status (hypertensive or healthy). Our
goal for this project is to use the regularised regression models to identify the genes that differentiate between hypertensive and healthy individuals.
